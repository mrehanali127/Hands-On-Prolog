## Overview
Our program explores the inter-family relationships of the Khan Family. It can find a person's  baap, beti, bahu, beta,
pota, dada, nawasa, nana, sussar, dadi, chachataya ,nani, khala, sala, or baapDada if that relationship exists.
The front end of the program is written in Python and the backend in Prolog. Python is a general-purpose and high-level programming language.
It is an interpreted language. On the other hand, Prolog is a logic programming language.
It is primarily intended as a declarative programming language. It has applications in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.
